## Step 1: Get Your Files Ready 📁

### Option A: If you can download from Figma Make
1. Click the download/export button
2. Save the ZIP file to your computer
3. Extract/unzip the file
4. You should see a folder called `dine-in-style`

### Option B: If you need to copy files manually
1. Create a new folder called `dine-in-style` on your computer
2. Copy each file from Figma Make into this folder
3. Make sure to maintain the folder structure (see FILE_CHECKLIST.md)

## Step 2: Install Node.js 🟢

If you don't have Node.js installed:

1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the **LTS version** (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. Restart your computer after installation

**To verify it's installed:**
- Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
- Type: `node --version`
- You should see something like `v18.0.0` or higher

## Step 3: Install Project Dependencies 📦

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Mac: Open "Terminal" app
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter

2. **Navigate to your project folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/dine-in-style
   ```
   Example on Mac: `cd ~/Downloads/dine-in-style`
   Example on Windows: `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\dine-in-style`

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will take 1-3 minutes. Don't worry if you see lots of text!
